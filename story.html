        Hey cutie guess what... We did it! We have been dating for 3 whole years. Can you believe it? Time has flown by so quick. Who would have that we would reach to this point.
        It's crazy to think that we both lived in Griffith our whole lives but have never seen each other until 3 years ago. It feels as though I have known you my whole life. Perhaps its fate that has brought us together.
        <br><br>
        You match my vibe and seem to understand me the way no one else has. You are special bae. Such as special girl who I have come across and have just been forever grateful she looked my way.
        I always think of how lucky I am to be loved and adored by you cutie. Thank you. For not just being there for me but for putting up with me shenanigans and faults. And through those faults
        I always improve myself to be not just a better man to be a better future husband.
        <br><br>
        I love you and I absolutely can not see myself with any other person other than you Lina. You have taken over my whole heart
        and now all I know is you. All I want is you. You just make me want to take care of you, to give you my all, to love someone with everthing I have. Believe it or not we are soul-bound. No matter what I will
        never let you go and hold you tighly my dear. For you are the girl of my dreams. This website is dedicated to remind you Lina that I love you and love only you, forever and ever.
